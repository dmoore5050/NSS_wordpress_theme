An awesome jQuery plugin that unleahes a Raptor of Jurassic proportions.

== Description ==

##We’ve all been here before...

You’re sitting at your desk, coding up a 500 page site, knee-deep in Extreme Cheddar Doritos sipping on a liter of Code Red Mountain Dew when you realize… this page would be som much more awesome with a VELOCIRAPTOR. You immediately scramble home to grab your Jurassic Park DVDs so can screencap a Velociraptor attack, but then you realize how hard it would be to make an awesome raptor run across the site you were coding. Plus, how are you going to get that trademark velociraptor screech? How about we let you in on a little secret?

###We already did it.

Well, the guys at [Zurb.com](http://zurb.com/ "Zurb.com") did it. And I made it into a WordPress plugin.

###The Options

What’s that? You want to be able to control the entrance handler? You can! Raptorize can be activated on a click event (that is the default and what we have hooked up above), a timer which just fires after the page is loaded, or the legendary Konami-Code. Our personal favorite is the Konami-Code (but it only works once per page load).

Go ahead, try the Konami Code (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A)

Works when you give a class of button to anything that can be clicked. i.e. <a href=”#” class=”button”>Button</a>

== Installation ==

1. Upload `raptorize-it` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add a class of button (class="button")

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this awesome? =

Yes.

= What if I have LazyLoader running? =

This might cause the image to not show up, only unleashing the raptor scream instead.
