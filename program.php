  <div class='twoThird'>
    <div class="marginPtag">
      <p>There are two ways to pay for your training at NSS: our standard tuition or by qualifying as a Nashville Tech Apprentice.  Out of a total of 24 seats in each cohort at NSS, our goal is to have 12 be Nashville Tech Apprentices and the remainder paying standard tuition.  
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h5 class="smallHeadline">Standard Tuition</h5>
  <p>The standard tuition program is new for 2014 - previously seats in our classes were only available to Nashville residents or those with strong local connections.  With this program we are now able to open up admission to Nashville Software School to:
    <ul>
      <li>Students who are shopping across the U.S. for a programming bootcamp and are interested in a six-month program like ours.</li>
      <li>Local residents who want to graduate unencumbered by the requirement to pay the school back for their training or go to work for one of our partners.  You may desire to work on your own tech startup or you may desire to live somewhere other than Nashville.</li>
      <li>Students whose tuition is being reimbursed by an employer. </li>
    </ul> 
  </p>
  <p><span>Tuition:</span> Full tuition for our January and April 2014 Bootcamps is $10,500.  However, if you accept a position through our job placement program, we will refund $3,000 of your tuition. Grants and scholarships are also available for students from underrepresented groups like women and minorities.</p>
  <h5 class="smallHeadline">Nashville Tech Apprentice Program</h5>
  <p>A Nashville Software School Tech Apprenticeship allows you to defer most of the cost of your training until you graduate and go to work as a software developer.  You will pay us $1,000 in tuition on acceptance to the program and then nothing else until after graduation.  After graduation, if you accept a position through our placement program from one of our partner companies, the rest your tuition will be reimbursed by your employer.  If you choose to go to work for someone other than one of our partners, we'll work with you to either negotiate payment from your new employer and/or work out a payment plan by which you can reimburse the school.</p>
  <p>A limited number of grants and scholarships are also available for students from underrepresented groups like women and minorities.  We also will make a limited number of cost-of-living stipends available on a needs-driven basis to Apprentices during the second 3 months of the Bootcamp.</p>
  <p><span>Tuition:</span> If you are accepted as a Nashville Tech Apprentice, you will he required to pay $1,000 in tuition on acceptance to the program.</p>

  <h5>Who should apply for a Nashville Tech Apprenticeship?</h5>
  <p>Apprenticeships are available to residents of Middle Tennessee or to those outside the area who are former residents, who have family in the area, or have some other strong local connection.  A connection strong enough that we can feel confident that you plan to stay in Nashville after you graduate from NSS.  Our Apprentice program is designed to provide access to a career as a professional software developer irrespective of economic circumstances for those who are committed to work and live in Middle Tennessee.</p>
  <p>If you want to be free of obligation after you graduate to NSS and to the Nashville tech community - if you want to be free to move elsewhere to work, if you want to be free to work on your own startups or projects, if you want to keep all of your options open for where you go or what you do after graduation, then our Apprentice program is NOT for you.  You should apply for acceptance in NSS as a regular student.</p>
  <p>To qualify as an apprentice, you must be fully committed to be in our classroom every day for six months from 8:30am until 4:00pm.  We are making a significant investment in the future when we admit a student as an apprentice.  You'll need to show us that you are as committed to your future as we are.  You also must expect a highly competitive admissions process.</p>
  <h5>How many Nashville Tech Apprenticeships are available in each Bootcamp?</h5>
  <p>We plan to start a new Bootcamp every 3 months during 2014: in January, April, July and October.  Our target is 24 total students in each Bootcamp.  We plan to accept 12 regular students and 12 Apprentices for each Bootcamp.<p>
